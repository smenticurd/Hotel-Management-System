--It is defined for the bookings table and will be executed after
--each DELETE operation on the table. The trigger will create a new 
--row in the bookings_audit table with the data of the deleted row in 
--the bookings table. The function_deleting() function is called by the 
--trigger each time it is executed. The function inserts the data of the 
--deleted row into the bookings_audit table and then returns the deleted data. 
--This trigger is essentially used to create an audit trail of all deletions from the bookings table.
