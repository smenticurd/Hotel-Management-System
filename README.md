# Hotel-Management-System

A hotel management database system is a computerized system that is used to manage the various operations and administrative functions of a hotel. It is designed to help hotels efficiently store, organize, and access information related to their guests, rooms, reservations, and other aspects of their business. The purpose of this type of database is to make it easier for hotels to manage their operations and provide better service to their guests. Some of the key features of a hotel management database system include the ability to manage guest reservations, track room availability and occupancy, process payments, and generate reports.

In this database I have 16 tables, Let's describe them:

* CENTERS - Table contains information about the various hotel chains in the database, such as the name and location of each chain.

* HOTELS - Table contains information about individual hotels, such as their location, contact information, and the hotel chain they belong to. The rooms table would store information about the rooms available at each hotel, such as the room type and number.
